# DSA-Amazon-Sales-Analysis
A data analysis project from DSA, exploring pricing, ratings, and revenue trends of Amazon products using Excel pivot tables and dashboards. The project identifies high-discount opportunities, sales potential, and product performance based on customer reviews and price ranges.

#  Amazon Sales Data Analysis
## Project Overview

This project analyzes a cleaned Amazon sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes product names, categories, prices, discounts, ratings, and calculated revenue potential. The goal is to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was provided during the DSA Data Analysis program. It contains cleaned Amazon India product listings, including prices, ratings, discount percentages, and estimated revenue. The data may have been originally scraped or simulated for educational purposes.

## Tools Used

1. Microsoft Excel
2. Pivot Tables
3. Dashboards
4. Data Cleaning
5. Charts and Visualizations

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before performing the analysis, the dataset underwent several data cleaning steps in Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy. This included:

- Removing duplicate product listings
- Splitting and standardizing product names and categories
- Calculating additional metrics such as revenue (`Selling Price × Number of Ratings`)
- Replacing empty columns

The cleaned version of the dataset is saved as **Amazon Cleaned Data.xlsx** and used for all pivot tables and dashboard visualizations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

An initial exploration of the cleaned dataset was performed to understand the data’s structure, detect outliers, and spot early patterns. This included:

- Reviewing category-wise product counts
- Summarizing discount percentages and price ranges
- Analyzing the distribution of ratings and number of reviews
- Using conditional formatting to highlight extreme values (e.g., 90%+ discount)

This helped identify which features had the greatest impact on perceived product value and potential sales.

##  Data Analysis

The final analysis was conducted using Excel pivot tables and visual dashboards. Key analyses included:

- **Discount vs. Rating**: Does giving a higher discount impact product ratings?
- **Revenue by Product**: Which products drive the highest revenue?
- **Top Discounted Items**: What percentage of products have ≥50% discount?
- **Category Trends**: Which product categories are the most dominant?
- **Review Score Impact**: Does more reviews translate into higher estimated sales?

All charts and insights were summarized into a clean dashboard for easy visualization and reporting.

## Key Metrics Analyzed

- Discount Percentage vs Rating
- Revenue Potential by Product
- Products with 50% or More Discounts
- Sales Category Distribution
- Rating and Review Score Impact

## Insights

- Over 60% of products analyzed were sold at a discount of 50% or more.
- Products in the ₹200–₹500 range dominate both in volume and revenue potential.
- Some products with very low ratings still contribute to high revenues due to large sales volumes.
